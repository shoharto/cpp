>> off screen: What are the differences if you're just writing HTML between an unordered list and an ordered list? Cuz obviously you are choosing the order in this unordered list.

But in an ordered list, we're gonna make a list of how we do something, and the order matters, okay? So actually why don't you go ahead and take two minutes. I'd like you to do the following. I'd like you to add to this page. Now, I'd like you to add a heading that says, how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, okay?

And then I want you to write an ordered list. Remember ordered list is an OL, it's gonna have exactly the same structure as what we have here for our ordered list, except it's OL instead of UL. It's all gonna have all the same li's. Go ahead and write an ordered list for all of the steps to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

The order matters, right? You can't spread peanut butter before you get your bread. Go ahead and try that now.
