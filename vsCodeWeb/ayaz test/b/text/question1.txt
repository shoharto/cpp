INTRODUCTION TO AJAX

What Is AJAX?

Ajax stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. 
It describes a set of development techniques used for building websites and web applications.


AJAX’s core function is to update web content asynchronously (the “A” of AJAX), meaning a user’s
web browser doesn’t need to reload an entire web page when only a small portion of content on
the page needs to change.


With Ajax,web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously without interfering
with the display and behavior of the existing page.

The above figure shows how AJAX works. The steps involve:

Browser sends an XMLHttpRequest

At server side:
Server processes the HTTPRequest
Server sends responses back to the browser
Browser receives the responses and updates the page
